- **Title slide** with topic and author info **mentioned before**.
- **Data:** Description of the data.
- **Analysis 1:** Description of the data on a key variable.
- **Analysis 2:** Description of the data on second variable in addition to a group comparison. 

## Where to find data?

## Code Chunk: Plotting
The following code is for visualizing different data. The purpose of this code is to help users create a map for whatever data they have that contains US states. 
**Packages to download:** 
```python
library(dplyr)
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```
Upload any data you have, the data I used was from class. 

```python
covid <- covid %>% drop_na()

covidcc <- covid %>% group_by(state)%>%
  summarise(count = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))

ggplot(covidcc, aes(x = state, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont", "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(x = "state", y = "Number of Cases", title = "COVID-19 Cases by state")
  ```
