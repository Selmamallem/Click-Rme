 - The Data was collected from The Journal Of Peace Research and is used to understand the motives of states' participation in the UN peacekeeping troop contributions.




-  The data was collected by scholar Dr. Gary Uzonyi, Department of Political Science, University of Massachusetts Lowell, in  his research paper, " Refugee flows and state contributions to post-Cold War UN peacekeeping missions," Journal of Peace Research 2015, Vol. 52(6) 743â€“757.

## Why do states contribute soldiers to United Nations peacekeeping missions?


The data explores the current understanding of UN peacekeeping troop contributions focusing on two aspects: 

- Which states participate in missions. 
- Which conflicts they send troops to and the size of contributions. 

The author also focuses on the benefits that countries get from reducing conflict and ensure stability to war-torn regions.


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

summarize(refpk,
min(refinflow,na.rm=T),
max(refinflow,na.rm=T))

summarize(refpk,

max(troops,na.rm=T))

lm(troops ~ refinflow, refpk) %>%

# Quick look on refugees and troops

The increase in refugee flows in relation to the number of troops deployed. 
Maximum number of refugees: 330001 refugees
minimum number of refugees: 0 refugees


Maximum number of troops: 7243 troops
minimum number of troops: 0 troops

In general, the number of refugees exceeds the number of troops deployed regardless of area. 

**When the refugee inflow increases, we predict the number of deployed troops will increase to 56.85.** 


**When the total number of refugees increases by 100000, the number of troops deployed increases by 11.27.**

```{r plot 1, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}

ggplot(refpk,aes(refinflow,troops))+
  geom_jitter(color= "black", shape = 10, fill= "lightblue", size=3) +
  coord_cartesian(x=c(0,400000),
                         y=c(0,8000))+
  labs(x= 'Refugee inflow',
         y= 'peacekeeping force') 
```
- There is a correlation between the number of troops deployed by a state and the number of refugees inflow (in addition to the
total number of refugees fleeing conflict areas).

```{r plot 2, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
      
ggplot(refpk,aes(totalrefs,troops))+
  geom_jitter(color= "black", shape = 10, fill= "lightblue", size=3) +
  coord_cartesian(x=c(0,3000000),
                  y=c(0,8000))+
         labs(x= 'Refugee inflow',
                y= 'peacekeeping force') 

                
```
- The refugee emergence from a conflict area  led to limited deployment  of peacekeeping forces  from third-party states.

```{r plot 3, echo= F, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}

newref <- filter(refpk,missioncode==55,year==1993)
filter(newref,!is.na(regime)) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(distance,contribute)) +
  geom_jitter(height = 0.055,
              shape = 25,
              size = 1,
              aes(fill = regime)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,
              lty = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks=c(0,1),
    labels=c('N', 'Y')) +
               labs(x = 'Distance',
                      y = 'Contribution',
                      title = 'UN Peace Keeping contribution' )

```

- The graph shows that the closer a country is to ex, Cambodia, the higher the chances that a third-party state will send its troops as part of the UN Peace keeping mission.
